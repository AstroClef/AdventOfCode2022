# AdventOfCode2022
Figured this would be great practice and portfolio work to show growth over the years to come!

## What is Advent of Code?
It's an advent calendar but each "window in the box" requires you to input the correct answer to earn points, and see a final image (I presume; it's my first time).

Here's the link if you what to take a look into it:

## Why did you use the C language, are you insane?
I dont think so, but i'm biased on my sanity.

I chose to use C because its one step above Assembly and it is the foundation of many modern programming languages that I also enjoy using like C#, Java, and Python.

Using C# and Python would've made the project far easier since I wouldn't have to keep researching why I keep getting a bunch of memory related exceptions that provide very little help in what's causing the issue.

Ultimately I want to understand how the languages I like work in the backend, stuff we take for granted like Strings, Dictionaries, Objects, etc..

... the real answer: I'm taking the Harvard CS50 course in paralell to this and I just want extra practice.

## How can I review your work?
Within this repository are folders for Each Day I've managed to complete this year.
The folder will contain both the source code that achieves the challenge, and a subfolder that will contain the executable and unique input file (if applicable to the problem).

The executable open a command prompt window that will detail the challenged I was asked to acheive. *Make sure the executable is in the same directory as it's paired input file if there was one.*
It will then ask if you want to see the detailed version to see step by step. If you answer yes, I've put code that walks through the processes I took to reach my conclusion.

## How can I get in touch?
### Are you a recruiter?
You've probably found me through LinkedIn, send me a direct message there!!!

### Are you my employer or future employer?
You should already have my contact information, feel free to get in touch!!!

### Are you a friend or family member:
You should already have my contact information, feel free to give me a call!!!

### Are you someone else?
Sorry, I'm very picky who I give my contact info to. *I might have a change of heart in the future - no promises though.*
